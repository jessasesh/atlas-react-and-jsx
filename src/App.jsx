      React is a JavaScript library that makes building responsive,
      scalable user interfaces straightforward and efficient.
      By using a component-based structure,
      it allows you to break your UI into reusable pieces of code.
      Its virtual DOM boosts performance by only updating whatâ€™s necessary,
      rather than re-rendering the whole page.
